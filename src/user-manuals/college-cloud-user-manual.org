#+Title: User Manual for Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition
#+Author: VLEAD

* Introduction
  This manual details the configuration/workflow process to be
  followed for Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition. The College Cloud
  machine will be running without GUI. GUI has been disabled for
  better performance results.

* Requirements
  + System Configuration (recommended) 
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 , CPU with 3.40GHz (Model : intel-db75en) 
     RAM : 16 GB 
     SMPS : 600 W 
     CPUs: 8
     MotherBoard wattage: 77 W 
     500 GB SATA
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  + WiFi Router : WiFi router which could serve 30-80 users.
  + Computer Lab with at least 30-80 Systems/Desktops.
  + Network Switch Input, from where all the labs would obtain DHCP
    IP) to Computer Lab machines/Desktops. This would make College
    Cloud accessible over the LAN network providing better results.
  + System Administrator with basic knowledge of CentOS operating systems and
    networking.

* Configuration process
  - Configure WiFi-Router :: Router has to serve 10.2.57.0/24 to
    its clients. That means we have to configure LAN settings in
    router such that router's dhcp server will serve IPs from the
    above IP range to its clients.
  - Take a LAN cable and connect it to college cloud machine. This
    connection has to come from router only. *Do not touch WAN port*
  - Take the HDD (portable-media)
  - Boot the machine from portable-media through USB
  - User credentials to log into the machine
    + User name :: vlabs
    + Password :: admin123
  - Run the following command on terminal to run virtual labs on
    OpenedX platform. This may take a few minutes to launch platform.
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cd vagrant-boxes
    vagrant-boxes$vagrant up #Look for Vagrant file in "vlabs" account and run this command
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  - Virtual labs are ready in our machine , we are ready to use the
    labs

* Using College Cloud Edition
  - College System Administrator/Workshop coordinator should follow
    the steps for enabling students to use labs from College Cloud.
** Selecting labs
   - Use the link =http://<College-Cloud-Machine-IP>:3000=
   - It will ask for the user name and password, provide following
     credentials
     + User Name :: admin
     + Password :: admin

   OpenVZ web panel is for managing Virtual Labs running on
   localhost (College Cloud). Each lab has one OpenVZ container. *By
   default, all lab containers are stopped*. But, server nodes will be
   in running state( We have to keep them running). 

   - Server nodes are

   - Once you are logged into web panel,
     + Look for =localhost= on left side of the panel and Click on
       =localhost=
     + Then you will be seeing all labs(stopped and running) OpenVZ
       containers

   - WARNING :: *Please don't mess around with the college cloud setup unless
                 you know what you are doing*. 

** Starting Lab containers
    - Go to OpenedX platform http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in
    - Select the course/lab that you want to take for the
      workshop. And remember the lab name
    - Go to =http://<College-Cloud-Machine-IP>:3000= and Sign into
      =OpenVZ web panel=
      + Use following user credentials
        User name : admin,    Password : admin
    - Click on =localhost= located at left side of the panel
    - Search for the lab name that you have selected in the Second
      step.
    - Then, choose that lab by clicking on CTID (ex.213) and look for
      =change state= button on the panel, and select =start=
      + If you face any problem, try starting container again.

** Enhancing Performance
    + If you are using server grade machine/system *(>=32 GB RAM,
      Intel Xenon processor)*
      - You can start all lab containers (that are stopped).
    + If you are using *Intel i7 processor and 16GB RAM
      machine/system*, 
      - In this kind of machine, maximum 50-100 simultaneous users can
        access one lab at a time.
      - Please start the labs that are needed for the workshop.
      - The best choice is,start one lab at a time and maximum of 10
        labs.
       
** Monitoring system resources
   Nagios is for monitoring systems resources such as load on the
   machine, RAM usage, Processes, etc.
   - Use the link =http://<College-Cloud-Machine-IP>/nagios=
   - User credentials are
     + User Name :: nagiosadmin
     + Password :: admin123
		   
** Changing DNS nameserver settings
   College System Administrator/Workshop Coordinator issue the
   following instructions to all lab users
   - Lab user can access the labs through LAN cable and also over
     wireless. LAN cable should be connected to WiFi-router.
   - Once the user is connected to wireless or LAN, lab user has to
     modify their *DNS name server setting*

     + *Linux*  
       - Open the file
         #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	         sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf
         #+END_EXAMPLE
       - Delete existing entries and add the following line
         #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
         nameserver 10.2.57.64
         #+END_EXAMPLE
     + *Windows*
        *Example: Changing DNS server settings on Windows OS*
        - Go to the Control Panel.
        - Click Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center >
          Change adapter settings.
        - Select the connection for which you want to configure Public
          DNS. For example:
          + To change the settings for an Ethernet connection,
            right-click Local Area Connection > Properties.
          + To change the settings for a wireless connection,
            right-click Wireless Network Connection > Properties.    
        - Select the Networking tab. Under =This connection uses the
          following items=, select =Internet Protocol Version 4
          (TCP/IPv4)= or =Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)= and
          then click Properties.
        - =Select Use the following DNS server addresses=. and add =10.2.57.64=
        - Disable wifi connection and enable wifi again.
       
** Setting No Proxy on browsers
   - Once the lab users got connected to wifi, lab user has to unset
     proxy if any proxies used previously( Set =No Proxy=) in their
     browsers . For example, In firefox, 
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Firefox --> Preferences --> Advanced --> Network --> Settings 
     #+END_EXAMPLE

** User registrations on Open edX platform
   - Users can register using register button on open edx platform page
     but they can not log out and login. to achieve this follow the
     steps
   - Admin user has log  into http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in/admin and
     then active the registered users.
     + User credentials are 
       - User name :: admin-vlabs
       - Password :: admin123
       - Email :: admin@vlabs.ac.in    
   - After logged in, go to =Authentication and Authorization= section
     + Select =Users= 
     + Click on =user name=
     + Click on =Activate=
     + Click on =Save= button at the bottom.
   - That's it, registered users can login and explore the courses

* Analytics and Feedback
** Analytics and Feedback : System Administrator
   1. System Administrator will be given a shell script.
       + Login as =vlabs= user to machine using following credentials
	 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	 username: vlabs
         password : admin123
 	 #+END_EXAMPLE
       + Modify =conf.sh= file
	 Add details to the fields such as =COLLEGE_NAME=, =EMAIL=

         #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	 sh /home/vlabs/script/fetch_analytics.sh 
         #+END_EXAMPLE
         The above script will get the dump of analytics and feedbacks
         and saves as =<InstituteName>-<DATE>.tar.gz=
       + Identify the IP address of your college-cloud-machine . By
         default it will be =10.2.57.61=. Use the following command on
         terminal to get the IP address.
         #+BEGIN_SRC command
         ifconfig br0
         #+END_SRC
       + System administrator has to share this IP to Workshop
         Coordinator. 
** Analytics and Feedback : Workshop Coordinator
       + Open a web browser on a machine connected to college-cloud/
         machine form which college-cloud was accessible.
       + Use the URL -
         =http://<your-college-cloud-ip>/college-cloud-data/=
       + Download the tar.gz file in the format
         <College-name-Date>.tar.gz
       + Take downloaded file in pendrive and take a machine with
         internet connection.
       + Upload the file in your google drive and share it with
         engg@vlabs.ac.in
