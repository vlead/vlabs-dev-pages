The repositories of all virtual labs are under organization [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs][Virtual Labs]] on
GitHub

There are over 100 labs currently using different technologies.  The effort is
to improve the labs in terms of:
  - Technology, move all the labs to use FOSS
  - Usability, ability to run the lab within a browser without any downloads
  - Pedagogy, filling the gaps in instructional quality of the labs.
