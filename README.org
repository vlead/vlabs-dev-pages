* Making changes 
  When making changes to the sources, always make them in the develop branch.  To
  test your changes, run =make stage= that will build the changes and copy the
  changes to =staging-dev.vlabs.ac.in=.  Once the changes are finalized, merge
  changes to master and run =make export= that will build and copy the files to
  =vlabs-dev.vlabs.ac.in=.

  Never make changes in the =master= branch.

* Testing your changes

1. Do not change the links to the style files in the sources!

2. Build your sources

3. Launch the local python server

4. Point your browser to =localhost:8000=
